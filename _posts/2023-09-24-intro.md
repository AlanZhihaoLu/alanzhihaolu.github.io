## Intro

**Hello world**, this is my first Jekyll blog post. That said, I am quite unfamiliar with all the ins and outs of using Jekyll. I would ordinarily prefer writing no-frills static webpages from scratch (because I like to think there is a sort of minimalistic aesthetic to plain HTML pages) but I thought using Jekyll would be a smoother experience in the long run - especially with Github pages integration.

To get straight to the point: I am doing this as a (currently) semi-informal means to showcase some tools I've developed over the past few years. I won't talk about anything here other than those things that I think might be useful to other people. If you'd like to know my personal opinions, beliefs, ideologies, fears, dreams, etc. - then you've come to wrong place, I'm afraid.

## What to expect
My specific experiences and current circumstances have encouraged me to develop a somewhat niche and non-standardized skillset. I've created a wide assortment of various tools over the years that aren't necessarily cohesive. If, however, any of them catch your eye, or somehow relate to your own needs, then please feel free to browse.
