## About me

I'm currently a PhD graduate student at the Visual Cognition Lab at the University of California, Davis. I use eye-tracking to study where visual attention is deployed in real-world environments. I'm interested in visual cognition, computer vision, and machine learning. 

My hobbies are developing web applications, creative writing, and reading existentialist philosophy. My less impressive hobbies include playing video games and watching funny Internet videos.
