## Hi!

Welcome to my website! I'm Alan.  

In this website, you can expect me to post some code snippets I've developed in the realm of data processing, image manipulation, and web-based experiments. I will refrain from posting too much about the specifics of my research, because I'd like to keep this page somewhat generalized to a broader audience and more utility-oriented for now (though subject to change).  

Also, I like looking at pretty data. If you have data you'd like to share or to get my opinion on, please send them my way. I'm open to almost any interesting collaborations, regardless of topic.
